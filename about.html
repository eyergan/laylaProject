    <p>
      Hello, my name is Layla Zaki Lakos! I grew up in Dubai, UAE in an
      American-Egyptian-Hungarian family. I now live halfway across the world
      with my husband in Seattle. Sadly, I don't have any pets but I do feed the
      crows in my alleyway.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently working as a metal fabricator and a video editor. It's a
      surprise to me too... my previous work experience was in farming,
      mediation, and advocacy.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love to draw comics (because I like pictures and words). I find a lot of
      inspiration in my Islamic upbringing and the practice of calligraphy
      (making words beautiful). Right now, I am working on a couple of projects
      that have to do with my Arab American identity. I spent a long time
      thinking that I'd better not share my thoughts because I didn't feel like
      a good representation of what a Muslim or Arab woman looked or acted like.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been lucky to meet many other multicultural people and have been
      sharing more. I am not trying to represent anything other than my own
      experience, which takes the pressure off of 'getting it right.'
    </p>

    <p>
      I fell in love with welding in college, where I became good friends with
      the Safety Director of the Sculpture Department. I learned how to weld. My
      first project was a slammable, lockable, functional door, that I later
      placed in the woods with the help of my friends. I have always oriented
      myself towards projects that serve some kind of function (although that is
      up to interpretation). My skills include: soldering / finishing /
      chainmaille sand casting / tig welding mig welding / general fabrication
    </p>
    <p>
      I would love to have more artistic collaboration in my life! It's the best
      way for me to learn, and refocuses art on shared experiences. That could
      mean creating a project, swapping art, skill sharing, or crafting
      something to support an organization. If there is something you see on my
      page that interests you, reach out and let’s work together!
