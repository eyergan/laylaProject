            I grew up in Dubai, UAE in an American-Egyptian-Hungarian family. I
            now live halfway across the world with my husband in Seattle. Sadly,
            I don't have any pets but I do feed the crows in my alleyway.

            I am currently working as a metal fabricator and a video editor.
            It's a surprise to me too... my previous work experience was in
            farming, mediation, and advocacy.

            I love to draw comics (because I like pictures and words). I find a
            lot of inspiration in my Islamic upbringing and the practice of
            calligraphy (making words beautiful). Right now, I am working on a
            couple of projects that have to do with my Arab American identity. I
            spent a long time thinking that I'd better not share my thoughts
            because I didn't feel like a good representation of what a Muslim or
            Arab woman looked or acted like.
          </p>

            I've been lucky to meet many other multicultural people and have
            been sharing more. I am not trying to represent anything other than
            my own experience, which takes the pressure off of 'getting it
            right.'

            I fell in love with welding in college, where I became good friends
            with the Safety Director of the Sculpture Department. I learned how
            to weld. My first project was a slammable, lockable, functional
            door, that I later placed in the woods with the help of my friends.
            I have always oriented myself towards projects that serve some kind
            of function (although that is up to interpretation). My skills
            include: soldering / finishing / chainmaille sand casting / tig
            welding mig welding / general fabrication
          </p>

            I would love to have more artistic collaboration in my life! It's
            the best way for me to learn, and refocuses art on shared
            experiences. That could mean creating a project, swapping art, skill
            sharing, or crafting something to support an organization. If there
            is something you see on my page that interests you, reach out and
            let’s work together!
